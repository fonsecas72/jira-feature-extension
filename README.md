# jira-feature-extension

This chrome extension will *prepend* "feature/" to the name of the branch when you push "Create branch" from JIRA

[Install](https://github.com/fonsecas72/jira-feature-extension/releases/download/1/jira-feature.crx)

The "feature" notation is used usually in git-flow to identify features. 

I don't like nor need git-flow to I've created this extension so I don't forget to append "feature" which would make my colleagues to not be able to use git-flow normally.
